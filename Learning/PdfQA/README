PDF Question Answering System

A system for answering questions from PDF documents. The project extracts text from PDFs, splits it into chunks, generates embeddings using Ollama Llama 3.2, stores them in a FAISS vector store, and answers user queries by performing a vector search to retrieve the most relevant context. This context is then passed to an LLM to generate accurate answers.

Features:
1.Extracts and splits text from PDFs.
2.Generates embeddings using Ollama Llama 3.2.
3.Vector search is used to find the most relevant context.
4.Passes the found context to the LLM for answering user queries.

Workflow:
1.Text Extraction: The PDF text is extracted and split into chunks.
2.Embedding Generation: Each chunk is embedded using Llama 3.2.
3.Vector Search: The user's query is embedded, and a vector search is performed to retrieve the most relevant chunks.

Setup:
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script and ask questions.
